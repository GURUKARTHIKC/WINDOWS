# WINDOWS
This is a project we had created a long time back. 

After our Middle-School, me and my brother were messing around with HTML and CSS. In this work, we have created a webpage that mimics the layout and basic behaviour of windows10. The file may have become outdated, but it still has a special place in my heart being my first "engineering" project.
